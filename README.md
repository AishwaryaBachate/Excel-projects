High-level Steps : 
•	Conducted detailed exploratory data analysis on key performance indicators (KPIs) such as year-on-year percentage change in complaints, timely response, and average resolution time to efficiently minimize and address end-user complaints.

•	Developed a dynamic dashboard to facilitate a high-level understanding of data across multiple granularities, including complaint channel, complaint type, product, location, etc.

Detailed Steps : 
•	Analyzed consumer complaints data from multiple organizations and developed strategies to enhance the complaint resolution process.

•	Examined various Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) such as year-on-year changes in the percentage of complaints, timely response to complaints, average resolution time, and monthly trends to gain insights into overall customer experience. This analysis was further done at the state level, bank level, product level, type of complaint, dispute status, channel, and time (month, year, day, week).

•	Created a dynamic Excel dashboard that includes all the aforementioned KPIs with interactive filters for location (state, region), product, channel, issue type, and time. This enables stakeholders to drill down and address specific areas of customer experience.

•	Formulated a strategy to prioritize complaints for resolution.

Insights : 

1.	Year-on-Year Complaint Trends:
•	There has been a noticeable increase in the number of complaints year-on-year, indicating growing customer awareness or potential issues with banking services, then decreased in 2016.

2.	Timely Response to Complaints:
•	A significant percentage of complaints are resolved in a timely manner. However, there are instances where response times exceed acceptable limits, which could affect customer satisfaction negatively.

3.	Average Resolution Time:
•	The average time taken to resolve complaints varies across different banks and products. Certain banks and product categories consistently show higher resolution times, highlighting areas for process improvement.

4.	Complaint Distribution by Product and Issue:
•	Complaints are concentrated in a few specific products and issues. For example, mortgage-related complaints and issues like loan servicing and foreclosure are prevalent.
•	This concentration suggests a need for targeted improvements in these areas to reduce overall complaint volumes.

5.	Complaint Channels:
•	Complaints are received through various channels, including phone, email, and online portals. Online portals show a higher volume of complaints, indicating their accessibility and customer preference for digital communication.

6.	Dispute Status:
•	A notable portion of complaints involves disputes that are not resolved in favor of the consumer, which could impact customer trust and loyalty.
•	Banks with higher unresolved dispute rates need to review their dispute resolution processes.

7.	State-Level Analysis:
•	Certain states report higher complaint volumes, which could be due to larger populations or specific regional issues.
•	State-level differences suggest the need for localized strategies to address specific concerns effectively.

Recommendations : 

1.	Improve Timeliness and Efficiency in Complaint Resolution:
•	Focus on reducing resolution times, particularly for products and issues with historically higher averages. Implementing more efficient processes and better resource allocation can help achieve this.

2.	Targeted Interventions for High-Complaint Products and Issues:
•	The concentration of complaints in specific products and issues indicates a need for targeted improvements. For example, enhancing customer support for mortgage-related services or providing clearer communication and assistance for loan servicing issues.

3.	Enhance Digital Communication Channels:
•	Given the high volume of complaints through online portals, banks should continue to enhance their digital communication platforms to ensure they are user-friendly and efficient in handling complaints.

4.	Strengthen Dispute Resolution Processes:
•	Banks with higher unresolved dispute rates should review and strengthen their dispute resolution processes to ensure fair and timely outcomes for consumers. This can help build trust and improve customer satisfaction.

5.	Localized Strategies for State-Level Issues:
•	The state-level differences in complaint volumes suggest that banks should adopt localized strategies to address specific regional issues. This can include tailored customer support, targeted communication, and specific service improvements.

Conclusion : 
The analysis of consumer complaint data reveals critical areas for improvement in the banking sector. By focusing on reducing resolution times, targeting high-complaint products and issues, enhancing digital communication, and strengthening dispute resolution processes, banks can significantly improve consumer satisfaction. Additionally, localized strategies and prioritization using Pareto analysis can lead to more effective and efficient complaint management.
