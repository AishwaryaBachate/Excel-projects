Sports Data Analysis

Description
The Sports Data Analysis Project is undertaken by XYZ Co Pvt Ltd, a company that organizes sports events at an international level. Countries nominate sportsmen from various departments, and our team has been given the responsibility to systematize the membership rosters and generate different reports as per business requirements. This project focuses on extracting valuable insights from key datasets within the Excelerate platform.

Key Objectives
•	To gain insights into gender-based analysis across different locations.
•	To understand gender distribution, country participation, and demographic patterns of participants in various sports settings.

Tools Used
•	Advanced Excel

Data Overview
•	Sportsmen Data: This dataset includes detailed information about sportsmen, such as their member ID, full name, birthdate, zodiac sign, gender, country, language, weight, eye color, blood type, sports location, sports type, and salary.
•	Sports Data: This dataset lists the different sports and whether they are indoor or outdoor activities.
•	Location Data: This dataset includes information about the languages spoken and the countries, identified by country code and name.

Steps Taken:
1: Data Cleaning and Additional Columns
In this step, I performed data cleaning and added new columns to the dataset. These columns included Gmail etc. and other necessary data transformations.

2: Summary Table Using Pivot Table
Using Excel's pivot table functionality, I created a summary table that counts the number of male and female sportsmen from different countries. This helps in understanding the gender distribution across various countries. 
Pivot Table - Count of MEMBER ID
Row Labels	Female	Male
ARGENTINA	1	2
AUSTRALIA	6	2
AUSTRIA	1	2
BRAZIL	0	1
FRANCE	3	6
GERMANY	1	4
NETHERLANDS	2	1
PORTUGAL	0	1
SPAIN	3	0
SWEDEN	1	1
UK	3	2
USA	4	3

3: Summary Table Using Pivot Table
Using pivot table functionality, I tried to get gender distribution, country participation, and demographic patterns of participants in various sports settings.

Insights
1.	Geographical Insights: The USA has the highest representation of sportsmen, both male and female, indicating a strong participation from this country. Other notable countries with significant representation include Australia and France.
2.	Gender Distribution: Certain countries like Argentina and Germany have a more balanced gender distribution, while others like Brazil and Portugal have a predominantly male representation.

Recommendations:
Increase Female Participation: Encourage more female participation in countries with low female representation, such as Brazil and Portugal, through targeted outreach and support programs.
Leverage Strong Participation: Capitalize on the strong participation from the USA by promoting more events and opportunities within the country to maintain and boost engagement.
Balanced Gender Representation: Aim for balanced gender representation in future nominations by setting specific targets and providing incentives for countries to nominate more female sportsmen.
Promote Lesser-Represented Sports: Encourage participation in lesser-represented sports.

Conclusion
The Sports Data Analysis Project, conducted by XYZ Co Pvt Ltd, provides comprehensive insights into the gender distribution and geographical representation of sportsmen. With these insights, the project offers valuable recommendations to optimize processes and strategies, thereby driving strategic decisions and improving overall participation and engagement in international sports events.
